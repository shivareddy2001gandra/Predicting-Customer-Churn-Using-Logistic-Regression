# Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Project Description
This project predicts customer churn using historical customer data. The dataset includes customer demographics, subscription details, usage patterns, and customer interactions. Logistic Regression is used to classify customers into 'churn' or 'no churn' categories, helping businesses identify customers at risk and take proactive retention measures.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, metrics)
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- NumPy (Array handling)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive coding environment)

## Files
- **data/customer_data.csv**: The raw data used for training the model.
- **notebooks/customer_churn_model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the analysis and modeling process.
- **src/data_preprocessing.py**: Contains functions for cleaning and preparing the data.
- **src/model_training.py**: Contains functions for training and evaluating the logistic regression model.
- **main.py**: Executes the project pipeline.
